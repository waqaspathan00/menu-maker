## Inspiration
In my area, I have a lot of small business owners. 
More specifically, individuals who cook and sell food straight from their homes. 
When they share their menus it's either as an image or a text message. 
Although this solution works, it feels very temporary and disorganized.

## Menu Maker
Our goal is to create an app where entrepreneurs, 
like home cooks, can quickly and easily make a menu. 
This menu will be shareable by link or QR code. 

## Mission Statement 
Provide a fluid experience for small business owners, 
like home cooks, to share information with prospective clients

**__What Sets Us Apart:__**
- Simple to use
  - Comprised of the core components of what a menu consists of: categories and category items
- Easy Accessibility
  - Shareable by link or QR code
  - Example: menumaker.com/pizzatime

**__Programming Languages/ Technologies Used__**
- Python
- React
- Firebase (for data storage and account login with google)
