## Inspiration

In my area, I have a lot of small business owners. 
More specifically, individuals who cook and sell food straight from their homes. 
When they share their menus it's either as an image or a text message. 
Although this solution works, it feels very temporary and disorganized.

## Goal
Our goal is to create an app where entrepreneurs, 
like home cooks, can quickly and easily make a menu. 
This menu will be shareable by link or QR code.

like home cooks, to share information with prospective clients
